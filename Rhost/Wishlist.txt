* MAJOR WISHES
- Please provide a SEARCH CLASS that works just like NAME but only matches on EXACT NAME (case insensitive). Maybe EXNAME ? REASON: Combine this with TOTEM and I'll have Customizable Namespaces that needs no complex softcode to manage / index. Yes this COULD be softcoded. It'd be really messy on debug output though.
- Please alter ATTRIBUTE-UFUN locks so that if I @lock/basic exit=ATTRIBUTE/MATCH, ATTRIBUTE is called with MATCH as an arg like %0. this will allow the functions to kinda-sorta-accept arguments?

* ZANY IDEAS:
- Customizable SEARCH CLASSES? Maybe some special search_class_obj with SEARCH_THING... again, could be softcoded, but...
